		<p>Greetings, Gamers!</p>
		<p>The first (and possibly ONLY) round of playtesting for Kismet is live! Head on over to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3329150/Kismet/">Kismet steam page</a> to sign up as a tester. So what does this entail?</p>
		<p>As a playtester, you'll play the game as normal and try to break it. That's it! (kind of...) You'll also have a chance to report any issues you encounter <a href="https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbyWHbPo7NfqDRNUAi6ukrZZkTTHbV1wk1lehD49ADo4AjA_4eoYtZu2Le5y3lnlRron/exec">here</a>. The version you'll be testing only includes one map and one mode so push it to the limits!</p>
		<p>Even if you only end up testing Kismet once, all help is greatly appreciated. So if you're apprehensive, give it a try! You might end up contributing to a future award-winning game.</p>

		<p>Greetings, Gamers!</p>
		<p>After years of work I'm happy to announce that Steam playtesting for Kismet will begin later this year! No clue what Kismet is? Go check out the trailer on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BelowAverageGames">BelowAverage</a> youtube channel. If you want to be involved in testing the next hit video game make sure you stay tuned for details on playtesting! So what's in store for the future?</p>
		<p>Firstly, smashing bugs! Most of the launch content is finished so my main priority during playtesting is to fix any glitches or issues present that I haven't found. After that, I'm going to improve split-screen and controller support, and add online multiplayer. Other than that I'm going to optimize the heck out of the game before the full release (and maybe add some secrets).</p>
		<p>I'll announce more about post-launch updates later on, but for now the plan is to add many maps and a maybe a few more game modes. Stay tuned here and on youtube for updates while you wait!</p>
